jQuery Wanderwall was a project I created in early 2010 to demonstrate how jQuery, HTML5, CSS3 and font-face could be combined to implement a visually pleasing 'hover-focused' UI. This version of the codebase will be significantly cleaner than the original and will aim to increase support for Opera, IE and (a hopefully) greater level of flexibility.
